In this project, we aim to segment customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach to gain insights into customer behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies. RFM analysis is a powerful technique that classifies customers based on three key metrics: recency of their last purchase, frequency of purchases, and the monetary value of their transactions.

The first step of the project involves data preprocessing, where we clean and transform the transactional data to create the RFM metrics for each customer. Next, we apply clustering algorithms, such as K-Means or hierarchical clustering, to group customers into distinct segments based on their RFM scores.

After obtaining the customer clusters, we conduct an in-depth analysis to understand the characteristics and behaviors of each segment. We identify high-value customers, potential churners, and loyal buyers, among other insights. By understanding these segments, we can tailor marketing strategies to target each group's unique needs and preferences.

The project aims to answer important business questions, such as which customer segments are the most valuable, which segments are at risk of churn, and how to retain and engage different customer groups effectively. The results of this analysis will help businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.

Ultimately, by leveraging the RFM approach and customer clustering techniques, this project seeks to enhance customer understanding and provide actionable insights for businesses to foster long-term customer relationships and drive growth.
